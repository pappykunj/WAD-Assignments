        <hr width="85%" align="left">
        <p>Phishing is a type of cybersecurity attack during which malicious actors send messages pretending to be a trusted person or entity. 
        Phishing messages manipulate a user, causing them to perform actions like installing a malicious file, clicking a malicious link, or divulging sensitive information such as access credentials.
        Phishing is the most common type of social engineering, which is a general term describing attempts to manipulate or trick computer users.
         Social engineering is an increasingly common threat vector used in almost all security incidents. Social engineering attacks, like phishing, 
         are often combined with other threats, such as malware, code injection, and network attacks.</p>
